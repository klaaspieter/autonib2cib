Cappuccino has been very successful at preserving the customary 'code and refresh' workflow for web developers. However, as any developer with more than a handful of cibs knows, having to manually run nib2cib breaks this workflow. Autonib2cib will solve this problem by automating the nib2cib process.

# Installation

autonib2cib requires pyfsevents and baker. Both can be installed with easy_install.

** pyfsevents **: `easy_install pyfsevents`

** baker **: `easy_install: baker`

# Usage

Run `python autonib2cib.py <PATH>`
